SMARTT (Sequencing-based Mutational Analysis of RNA Transcription Termination) 
is a high-throughput method for generating ligand-dependent in vitro 
transcription termination profiles. 

This repository contains two programs: 'SMARTT - Data Analysis Pipeline' and 
'SMARTT - Heat Map Maker'. More extensive README's describing their use can be 
found in their respective folders.
