SMART - Heat Map Maker

SMART stands for Sequencing-based Mutational Analysis of Riboswitch-induced 
Termination. SMART is a high-throughput method for generating ligand-dependent in 
vitro transcription termination profiles. The following is a guide for creating
heat maps of the fit parameters generated using SMART-DAP (SMART - Data Analysis 
Pipeline).

Requirements:

===================================================================================
Python 3.5 (or compatible version)
Required packages:
 - functools
 - math
 - numpy
 - operator
 - os
 - pandas
 - re
 - bs4
 
I recommend downloading and managing Python with the Anaconda platform 
(https://www.anaconda.com/download/) if you are new to programming in Python. All
of the required Python packages should come pre-loaded with Anaconda, except bs4,
which can be downloaded separately through Anaconda (see 
https://anaconda.org/anaconda/beautifulsoup4).
  
===================================================================================
Inkscape version 0.48 (or compatible version)

Inkscape can be downloaded at https://inkscape.org/da/download/.

===================================================================================
The script HeatMapMaker.py (provided herein).

===================================================================================
A csv file containing fits generated with Graphpad Prism 7 through SMART-DAP.

Execution instructions:

Creating heat maps with this script is a bit of an involved process. The main idea
for creating these heatmaps is to create an uncolored figure in Inkscape and 
manually label the regions that are to be colored. The HeatMapMaker.py script can 
then be used to color those objects according to the parameter values obtained 
through the fits generated with either PRISM or R using SMART-DAP.

===================================================================================
1. Manually create the RNA secondary structure in Inkscape.

This step should be fairly self-explanatory. It is important to note that the 
script modifies the fill color of labeled objects (see next step). In the example
provided, I change the fill color of the circles surrounding each nucleotide 
letter.

===================================================================================
2. Manually label the objects to be colored in Inkscape.

The 'object id' of each object that needs to be colored must be labeled according 
to its identity. For example, if the nucleotide object is associated with A15U/C/G, 
its 'object id' needs to be labeled as A15. This needs to be done for all objects 
associated with a nucleotide position in the fits generated with PRISM or R using 
SMART-DAP.

Object id's can be changed by selecting the object and clicking 'Object properties' 
under the 'Objects' tab or by typing 'Ctr + shift + o' after selecting the object.

***
NOTE: When labeling objects, uppercase RNA letters (ie. use 'U' and not 'T') must 
be used.

Correct:
- A15
- U25
- G32

Incorrect:
- a15
- T25 or t25
- g32
***

===================================================================================
3. Use the HeatMapMaker.py script to create colored heat maps.

HeatMapMaker.py takes the SVG file created with Inkscape and modifies the fill 
color of relabeled objects based on the parameter values obtained through the fits 
generated with either PRISM or R using SMART-DAP. HeatMapMaker.py determines the 
mean value of the values associated with a labeled position and determines the 
new color by linear interpolation.

Input and output filenames, as well as several other parameters, need to be 
hardcoded into this script. These parameters are annotated in the script and 
hopefully are fairly intuitive. They can be found in the section labeled 
"Variables to edit". One of the most important of these is 'parameter_type'. 
This determine which parameter (Ymin, Ymax, K, or Amp) is used when determining 
the fill color.

Usage (default setting is to analyze the demo file):
python HeatMapMaker.py

File types:
- An annotated SVG file containing the RNA secondary structure (see steps 1&2) and 
  a CSV file containing the fit parameters generated with SMART-DAP are required 
  as input files.
- An SVG file is created as the output
